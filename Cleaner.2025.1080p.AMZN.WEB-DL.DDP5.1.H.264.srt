1
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:20,982
Get in the house.
Get in the house.

2
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,249
Hey, hey, hey.

3
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,520
How many bloody
times do we have to do this?

4
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,589
It's not my fault.
It's his fault.

5
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:30,223
- I'll take care of him.
- Michael, can you hear me?

6
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,425
It's fine.
It's fine.

7
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,994
Why are
you protecting him?

8
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:36,229
I thought you'd grown up by now.
Can you hear me?

9
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,732
Don't you touch him!

10
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,499
Why
don't you listen to me, Michael?

11
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,268
I can do what I like.
He's my son.

12
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,637
Leave him alone!

13
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,405
Listen!
Freak.

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,776
I'm the only one who can freak
him, ain't I, Michael?

15
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,777
Why ain't you listening to me?

16
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,579
You're not gonna do
that...not that...

17
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,714
Why aren't you
listening to me?

18
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,881
Stop!

19
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:56,283
You're not gonna
embarrass me anymore.

20
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,353
You bully! Get
out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

21
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,754
Hello?

22
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,456
Right now? I'm late for work.
Can I come in later?

23
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,694
Okay.

24
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,897
Okay. I'll be there.

25
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,498
Shit.

26
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,976
I can't believe I'm
hearing this. Are you serious?

27
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,244
Is she serious?

28
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,913
This is a joke,
an absolute joke.

29
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,249
I think the key issue
here is accountability.

30
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,917
- Accountability?
- Your brother

31
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,452
is in clear breach
of our code of conduct.

32
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,054
We have no choice but
to terminate

33
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,321
his placement
here immediately.

34
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,525
That's good. That's really good.

35
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,593
I appreciate
that you're upset.

36
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,061
Excuse me?

37
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,429
- Do you need to get that?
- No.

38
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,566
- Let's just calm down.
- Calm down?

39
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:01,135
- Don't tell her to calm down.
- I am wary of his triggers.

40
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,804
I'm purely looking out
for Michael.

41
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,071
No, you're not.

42
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,940
This is, what, the seventh,

43
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,242
no, eighth placement
to have fallen through.

44
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,310
Ninth. It's the ninth placement.

45
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,679
Right. See? Ninth.

46
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,682
There was Rose House,
Clinton House, Thomas Lodge.

47
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,584
- Yes, ninth.
- Inckenfield Lane.

48
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,821
Rose House again, counts as
twice. Ford Lands, Goldsmiths...

49
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,623
- Yes. Thanks, Michael.
- Lantern and here.

50
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,325
- That makes nine.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,561
You're welcome.

52
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,330
Someone stole confidential
care home account information

53
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,133
and leaked it
to the local press.

54
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,569
Someone. You don't know that
was Michael. Where's the proof?

55
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,204
It's not the first
time your brother

56
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,905
has bypassed our
online security.

57
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,406
It could have been anyone.

58
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,209
And, actually, if you
hadn't been stealing from people

59
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,743
you're supposed
to be looking after,

60
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,213
maybe there'd be
nothing for anyone to leak.

61
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,014
Technically,
it is a criminal matter.

62
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,250
Your brother's lucky we're not
pressing charges for data theft.

63
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,653
Theft? You stole money from him
and now you're kicking him out.

64
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,387
Well, it sounds like Michael

65
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,057
would be better off
living with you.

66
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,558
A hundred percent.

67
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,227
I'm sorry. We have no choice.

68
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,461
His placement here
is no longer tenable.

69
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,930
Michael needs to leave.

70
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,233
Today. Now.

71
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,667
Great.

72
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,136
I have work. I don't even
have time to get your things.

73
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,905
We'll forward them on.

74
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,744
Fuck.

75
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,485
You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

76
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,956
- Like you have a lawyer.
- She doesn't know that.

77
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,961
Derek, I was just about to call.

78
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,164
<i>Late and full of shit.</i>
<i>We've spoken about this, Joey.</i>

79
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:38,733
Technically,
I'm not that late.

80
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,101
<i>Technically, you're sacked.</i>

81
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,637
No, no, no, no. Look, Derek,
it was a family emergency.

82
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,073
Please, I cannot lose this job.
I swear I'll be there by...

83
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:49,476
<i>Two. Get here by two.</i>

84
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,389
So, how was your day?

85
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,890
Well, first my boss
was being a...

86
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,025
Please don't swear.

87
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:04,892
Bad word. Cos I was late.

88
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,394
Then I got a call
to come and get you.

89
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,828
And cos my boss is a bad word,

90
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,730
if I'm not in by two,
the bad word will sack me.

91
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,998
Apart from that, great. You?

92
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:12,934
Yeah, I'm happy.
I get to be with my sister.

93
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,269
Oh, please don't swear.

94
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,171
- For fuck...

95
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,084
You wouldn't know who hacked the
care home account to leak them?

96
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,586
- Are you cross? You seem cross.
- Yeah, I am.

97
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,955
With the care home,
and those wankers

98
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,357
- for stealingy our allowance.
- Joanna.

99
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,225
- They have to face justice.
- They do.

100
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,395
Just not sure they will.
It's not how the world works.

101
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,898
That's why I wanna be
a crusader for the truth.

102
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,566
Like Piers Morgan.

103
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,601
Piers Morgan is an
attention-seeking

104
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,237
the worst word.

105
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,041
Well, Piers Morgan wouldn't
have got on the wrong bus.

106
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,678
Fuck!

107
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,552
No more swearing.

108
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,720
I said I'm sorry.

109
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,793
Motherf...

110
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,201
Stop. Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

111
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,870
- My charger. I left my charger.
- We'll get one later.

112
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,672
- You don't understand.
- Michael...

113
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:28,843
I'm at seven fucking percent!
Where is my fucking charger?

114
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,313
- No! No!
- Michael. Michael.

115
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,881
- You...
- Michael.

116
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,316
- You don't... You...
- Michael.

117
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,851
Do you need a squeeze?

118
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,724
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

119
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,727
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

120
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,475
When are we going home?

121
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,544
You'll have to hang
here till I finish at six.

122
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,446
Six? That's two <i>Lord</i>
<i>of the Rings.</i>

123
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,615
Or one extended edition.

124
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,852
I've got five minutes.
Come on.

125
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,316
Big Ron will keep an eye on you.
He'll make sure you're okay.

126
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,318
How's it going, Michael?

127
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,853
Does he know I'm autistic?

128
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,155
He knows. He's cool.
It'll be fine.

129
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,423
Does he have a charger?

130
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,292
I can sort that
out for you, mate.

131
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,729
And he'll look after your bag.

132
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,364
I'll be back in a minute.

133
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,668
There's a lot of people.
It's busy.

134
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,769
There's a party tonight.

135
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,237
We're not invited and
you hate parties.

136
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,540
Can't I just come with you?

137
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,641
You could get me a job here.

138
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,643
You don't wanna work here.
My bosses are dicks.

139
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,479
- Well, you do.
- Outside the building.

140
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,981
Away from the dicks.
I'll be back.

141
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,519
And home...
Am I staying with you?

142
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:20,555
- Until we find a new placement.
- I don't like the placements.

143
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,690
We'll talk about this later.
I have to go.

144
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,093
- It's always later.
- You're staying tonight.

145
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,828
For how long?

146
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:30,397
I need to go.
Stay with Big Ron.

147
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,108
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

148
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,553
The gala is all set.

149
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,854
18:00 hours,
guests arrive, cocktails begin.

150
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,724
18:20, Geoffrey to give
brief shareholder speech.

151
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,892
I've allowed 30 minutes.

152
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,563
18:21, my will to live expires.

153
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:02,796
Oh, and just to flag,

154
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,332
there will be live performers
before and after.

155
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,902
It's gonna be all <i>Cirque du</i>
<i>Soleil</i> crap, isn't it?

156
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,638
Just make sure they
give us a wide berth.

157
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,540
I want a fucking
ten-metre exclusion zone.

158
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,842
- The theme's divine renewal.
- I really don't give a shit.

159
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,044
Are you dipping, Gerald?

160
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,347
Yes. I think
I'm fucking dipping.

161
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,462
Jesus Christ. Breathe in.

162
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,802
You'd better not fucking
drop now. You should be at home.

163
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,305
Maybe if you paid proper
maternity leave, she would be.

164
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,946
17 seconds. I made it.

165
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,284
We really need to have a chat
about your attitude, Joey.

166
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,919
It's no wonder
the army kicked you out.

167
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,755
Love to. Got to get to work.

168
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,458
My boss can be a real
pain in the arse.

169
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,694
Your boss would love you to.

170
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,563
You still owe me an hour,
at least.

171
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,030
- What?
- I'll add it on.

172
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:46,000
You can start with a...

173
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,969
bird strike.

174
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,708
- Come on.
- Level 51, panel F 51 P 118.

175
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:56,176
Should be
properly baked on by now.

176
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,781
- That's borderline harassment.
- Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.

177
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,290
Ooh!

178
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,626
- Missed a bit.
- Definitely not funny.

179
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,161
See, I thought you weren't
even coming in today, slacker.

180
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,298
- Some of us are almost done.
- I had to sort something.

181
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,933
Oh, yeah?

182
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,569
They kicked Michael
out of his care home.

183
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,269
- Oh, man. What?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,005
He hacked their records, accused
them of stealing his money.

185
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,341
- So, yeah, it's a shitshow.
- Fuck.

186
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,343
That's my El Capitan
climb screwed.

187
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,847
Shit, I'm so sorry,
man. How's he doing?

188
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,115
- He's alright.
- Oh, yeah?

189
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,051
- He's downstairs.
- You brought him here?

190
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:48,222
It was that or get fired.
It's cool. He's with Big Ron.

191
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:53,193
Alright, Michael? Have that.

192
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,964
Is my phone charged?

193
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,933
Hold on.

194
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,571
Oi!

195
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,985
<i><i>- Gerald?</i>
- That cleaner in the lift.

196
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,453
<i>There were two</i>
<i>cleaners in the lift.</i>

197
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,287
The non-pregnant one.

198
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,823
- The lippy one.
The window cleaner.

199
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,123
<i>We can't sack her</i>
<i>for being lippy</i>

200
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,659
<i>if that's what</i>
<i>you're about to ask.</i>

201
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,094
<i>- I'll call her line manager.</i>
- Do it.

202
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,697
Nice of you to join us.

203
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:32,199
- Bloody hate these things.
- Yes.

204
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,134
Well, if you could possibly find
it within yourself

205
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,469
to soldier through.

206
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,038
- Fine.
- And smile.

207
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:41,241
Good to see you.

208
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,911
Gerald. You're looking well.

209
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,914
- Am I? Shall we do this?
- Yes.

210
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,783
Right, I'll tee up,
you play off.

211
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,519
Nothing too taxing, I promise.

212
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:54,121
- Great.
- Absolutely.

213
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,796
With me are
Geoffrey and Gerald Milton,

214
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,199
owners and CEOs
of Agnian Energy.

215
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,668
Thank you for joining me.

216
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,202
- Pleasure.
- Absolutely.

217
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,838
Demand has never been higher,

218
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,906
but there is
a great deal of uncertainty

219
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,808
in the energy markets right now.

220
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,342
Agnian is riding high.

221
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,847
You have your shareholder
gala this evening to celebrate.

222
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,548
What is Agnian doing right?

223
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:23,183
Here at Agnian, we see
meeting the world's energy needs

224
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,352
as a privilege and a duty.

225
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,487
Absolutely.

226
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,523
Billions of people
depend on energy,

227
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:31,358
but it has to be provided
sustainably and responsibly.

228
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,392
Absolutely.

229
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,328
My brother and I
and everyone here at Agnian

230
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,966
are passionate about cleaner
strategies for a cleaner future.

231
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,233
Absolutely.

232
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:07,662
Want some?

233
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,899
Ooh!

234
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,300
- Nice.
- Oh, shit.

235
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,069
There's a bird strike on 51.
Derek wants you to clean it.

236
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,806
Right. And he just
forgot to tell me.

237
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,073
- Okay.
- He did.

238
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,776
- Sure.
- So I'm telling you now.

239
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,143
- Stop it.
- 51.

240
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,345
Stop it.
You're embarrassing yourself.

241
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:29,617
- Who got you this job?
- Not so I could do yours.

242
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,754
Fuck it. I'll get to it later.

243
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,823
<i>Agnian</i>
<i>believes in reducing emissions,</i>

244
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,291
<i>not output.</i>

245
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,895

248
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,168
So what do you think?

249
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,773
I'm thinking, 'Jesus Christ.
How much did that cost?'

250
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,309
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,377
You're very kind,
but you haven't heard...

252
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,081
I'll get that fixed.

253
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,350
No, well,
don't feel you have to.

254
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,319
<i>And we want you to join us</i>

255
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:09,757
<i>in our shared journey towards</i>
<i>a brighter, cleaner future.</i>

256
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,238
Now who's slacking?

257
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,342
You gotta enjoy
these moments, Joey.

258
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,646
Human life is a fleeting thing.

259
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,849
- All flesh is grass.
- Thanks, Buddha.

260
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,954
Look at us,
just like fuckin' ants, just...

261
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,122
Hey, do you ever wonder what
it was like before we were here?

262
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,123
Are you high?

263
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,592
<i>- Hey, Noah.</i>
- Hey, Derek.

264
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,594
<i>You need to finish up.</i>
<i>The gala starts in an hour.</i>

265
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:47,629
Okay. Wow.

266
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,329
<i>- We have to clear the building.</i>
- No, listen,

267
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,198
I don't know how you
make it through the day, mate.

268
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,300
You're an inspiration
to all of us, D, genuinely.

269
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,502
<i>Yeah, I've been told</i>
<i>to wrap it up.</i>

270
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:56,236
- Yeah, okay.
<i>- You need to finish up.</i>

271
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,705
Derek says turn
your earpiece on.

272
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,139
He knows it's not broken.

273
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,909
- He's smart like that.
- Hi, Derek.

274
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,878
You pissed off
a Milton in the lift.

275
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,046
He was being a dick.

276
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,246
<i>When you own the building,</i>

277
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,749
you get to be a dick.

278
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:10,952
<i>- What's your excuse, D?</i>
- Clean the fucking bird.

279
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,821
Right, I'm done.
Have a good one, yeah?

280
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,624
Listen, I hope it's all
okay with Michael, seriously.

281
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:20,160
Look after him, yeah? I mean,
I know you know that, but...

282
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,964
Maybe take him somewhere
nice after you knock off.

283
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,566
- Will do, Dad.
- Later, Joey.

284
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,668
Right.

285
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:38,012
This is an important night.
These are important people.

286
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,647
Let's make sure it's a good one.

287
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,449
Clear as you go,
drinks topped up...

288
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,329
It's our values.

289
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:59,366
Agnian Values.

290
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,270
Sustainability.

291
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,606
Sustainability.

292
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,342
- Hi, Joey.
- You can't be up here, Michael.

293
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,512
You'll get me sacked.
Go down. I'll be two minutes.

294
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,347
- I want to go home.
- Get in the lift and go down.

295
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,218
- You can't tell me what to do.
- Yes, I can. Go down.

296
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,086
- Fuck off!
- I don't need this shit.

297
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,956
- Fuck you, Joanna!
- No! Fuck you!

298
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,624
Go on, then!

299
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,258
Where are you going? Come back!

300
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:03,030
- Away from you, like you want!
- Fuck!

301
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,934
Shit.

302
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,870
<i>Have you cleaned that bird yet?</i>

303
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:11,806
- It's done. I'm coming up.
- Nah ah ah ah.

304
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,510
Nice try. Get in.
I'll take you there.

305
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,344
Or you're not clocking off.

306
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,846
Derek, I've got
something I have...

307
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,847
<i>Bullshit.</i>

308
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:20,948
Get on with it.

309
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:21,983
Fuck.

310
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:26,954
Fuck!

311
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,514
Prick.

312
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:58,519
<i>Prick</i>
<i>with his finger on the override.</i>

313
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:13,868
But it's our values,
it's Agnian values...

314
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,270
- Geoffrey.
- Erica.

315
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:19,173
So my video's
going down a storm.

316
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,575
Oscar worthy.

317
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:22,310
I want much more than that.

318
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,611
Really?

319
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,614
Say, VP of brand strategy?

320
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:29,250
No doubt you're to blame
for inflicting the

321
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,252
Shit de Soleil on us.

322
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:34,589
'Du.' It's 'du Soleil',
Geoffrey.

323
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,925
'Du' you think I care?

324
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,495
Where the hell is Gerald?

325
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,867
Oh. Last seen
dry-humping Alison Pope.

326
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,035
Alison Pope? From Morgan?

327
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,938
And don't erupt, but the
performers are going to be late.

328
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:54,108
Alison-fucking-Pope. Jesus.

329
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,581
Fuck you, Derek.

330
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,131
Fuck.

331
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,635
Are you okay?

332
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,469
What was that?

333
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,861
Okay, done. Get me up, Derek.

334
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,997
Derek? Derek!

335
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:53,968
Just going for a slash.
Back in five.

336
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,137
Maybe ten.

337
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,039
Just get me up.

338
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,055
Where the fuck have you been?

339
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,456
And don't say traffic.
We've all got GPS.

340
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,093
Geoffrey's about to go on,
so you'll have to wait.

341
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,529
I'd get in there and show face.

342
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:48,756
Cheers.

343
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,634
Excuse me.

344
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:15,049
Idiot.

345
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:21,856
Good evening.

346
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:28,829
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You're very kind.

347
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,098
But you haven't heard
what I have to say yet.

348
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,102
And we are not going to.
Come on.

349
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,270
But what a year,

350
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:39,073
and if I have to tell you just
how good it's been,

351
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:42,076
I suggest you
hire new accountants.

352
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,953
Come on, Derek, Jesus.

353
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,688
You know what
your problem is, Joey?

354
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:57,758
Is it the prick with
his finger on the override?

355
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,834
It was a joke, Derek.

356
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:15,776
What are you doing?

357
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,179
<i>Derek!</i>

358
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,119
You did not have
to fucking kill them.

359
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,588
Stick to the plan.

360
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,199
Derek, stop dicking around.

361
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,677
And we are in.

362
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,013
Because it's our values,
Agnian values...

363
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:55,249
Yes, we do have them.

364
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:59,554
Sustainability, transparency,
responsibility, trust,

365
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,755
which drive our mission.

366
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,457
Beautiful.

367
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,826
Beautiful words, Geoffrey.

368
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,830
Very inspiring.

369
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,969
If only a single
one of them was true.

370
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,395
Four hours till
the fairy dust wears off.

371
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,898
Bibbidy-bobbidy bye-bye!

372
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,974
We are Earth Revolution,

373
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,776
and our takeover tonight
will usher in a new dawn.

374
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,746
If you are good,
if you play nice,

375
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,616
I promise you
will live to see it.

376
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,684
Ooh, sounds so scary.

377
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:11,852
Lifts and doors
locked up to your level.

378
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,222
All calls and comms jammed.
No alarms raised.

379
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:17,491
<i>This is our house now.</i>

380
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,638
Greedy, Needy, Sleazy,

381
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:34,676
Selfish,
Snorty, Deceitful, Cocky.

382
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:37,411
We're one short. Where's Gropey?

383
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,814
Geoffrey, where's Gerald?

384
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,851
Where's your brother, G?

385
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,291
I only ask once.

386
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,231
527!

387
00:29:57,264 --> 00:30:01,536
Apartment 527.

388
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:20,454
There we go.

389
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,602
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

390
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,572
Hey, Gerry.

391
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,173
Let's go.

392
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,876
Ooh. Steady, now.

393
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:54,589
Window cleaner. Window cleaner.

394
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,691
What's that, Gerry?

395
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,326
Window cleaner.

396
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,063
And there was me thinking that
you never gave us a second look.

397
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,100
What the fuck?

398
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,470
Who owns
the building now, Gerry?

399
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:30,924
Help! Help! Hey!

400
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,528
Look up! Hey!

401
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:37,064
Look up! Hey! Hey...

402
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:41,969
...up!

403
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,026
Shit.

404
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,431
Okay, Joey,
get a grip. Michael needs you.

405
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:13,500
Stay calm,
Michael. Joanna needs us.

406
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:15,870
Think, think, think.

407
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:19,006
What would...what would
Piers Morgan do?

408
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:43,698
Room service.
Where d'you want him?

409
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,703
We're on the clock. Let's go.

410
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:50,103
Make him decent.

411
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:54,975
Noah.

412
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,545
Make him decent.

413
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,723
Marcus Blake. Cheers.

414
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,627
Mmm!

415
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,129
Duval-Leroy. Very nice.

416
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:20,467
Let's have no hysterics,
no heroics, no drama.

417
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,002
You think this is the
first time people

418
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,303
have tried to take
money from us?

419
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:26,039
Let us go, and whatever you
were hoping to steal,

420
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,374
we'll double it.

421
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,844
He thinks we want their money.

422
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,746
We don't want your money, Geoff.

423
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,820
- What do you want?
- We wanna save the world.

424
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:39,988
I don't understand.

425
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,391
I love this
'Friends of the Earth' stuff.

426
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:50,230
'Fuel your life the green way.'
Jesus Christ. Zee?

427
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:55,435
<i>Agnian</i>
<i>believes in reducing emissions,</i>

428
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,838

429
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,239

432

433

434
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,720
Doesn't look like
friendship to me, Geoffrey boy.

435
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,154
It doesn't, does it?

436
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,257
I mean, do friends plunder,
choke and rape?

437
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,662
Noah, we can't do this
without them. Let him go.

438
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:26,166
I said let him go!

439
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,304
You'll have to forgive him.
He gets a little excited.

440
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:35,777
Right, so this
is Laguna Taracoa.

441
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,478
You should know it
because Agnian has been dumping

442
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,314
billions
of gallons of waste there,

443
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,150
an entire ecosystem
completely destroyed.

444
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,152
Ring any bells?

445
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,823
No? How about now?

446
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:53,493
Elena Lanza. She was with us
when we sabotaged

447
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,530
the Taracoa
pipeline last year.

448
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,599
She was caught
and was gonna use the trial

449
00:34:57,632 --> 00:35:00,635
to tell the world what
you've been doing there.

450
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,235
No?

451
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,272
How about this?

452
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,341
You had her killed.

453
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,010
Elena was found
murdered in her cell,

454
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,178
so the trial never
takes place.

455
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:15,382
No smoke without fire,
right? So what do you do?

456
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,852
You sit down with your
friends in Parliament,

457
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,219
the press,
social media,

458
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:22,356
you downplay, deny,
keep the disinformation pumping,

459
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,993
just so long as those
oil licences keep coming

460
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:27,327
and the Agnian
stock keeps climbing.

461
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,362
Zee.

462
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:33,067
There's a Taracoa every
month and Elena every week.

463
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:36,704
And the world does nothing.
Until now.

464
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:39,339
Tonight you are accountable.

465
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:40,775
You can't prove any of this.

466
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,143
You're right,
Geoffrey, we can't, but you can.

467
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:46,748
You fucking cowards.
You won't get away with it.

468
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:50,718
Did you say 'cowards'?

469
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,387
We've stood before
bulldozers in the Amazon,

470
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,056
been shot at by whalers,

471
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:58,893
seen our brothers and sisters
killed for what they believe in.

472
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:00,160
What are you?

473
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,698
You're a fat,
ugly man in a suit.

474
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:07,869
Are you insane?
Are you hearing this?

475
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:09,236
So this is what's gonna happen.

476
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,405
You are gonna
give Zee your passwords

477
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,740
and she's gonna expunge

478
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:15,109
every guilty secret
from your accounts.

479
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:17,679
You're then gonna
confess your crimes.

480
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:20,213
We're gonna shine a
light on every lie,

481
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:22,984
bribe and abuse
and then reveal it to the world.

482
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,086
Once the truth goes viral,

483
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,288
you and Agnian stock
will be worthless.

484
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,592
Provided you comply,
you will then be released.

485
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,094
By us at least.

486
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:35,763
What happens beyond that,
out of my hands.

487
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,330
Let's discuss this.

488
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,834
We have everyone here to
give you a platform.

489
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,838
You don't understand,
Geoffrey. You are the platform.

490
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,440
But you said yourself,
you need people onside.

491
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:50,545
Come on.
We can talk this through.

492
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,843
What the hell
is wrong with you?

493
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,111
Enough fucking talk.

494
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:25,278
Marcus, you're breaking bread
with them and having a go at me?

495
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,347
- Fuck you.
- We agreed, no killing.

496
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,449
You knew exactly who I
was before you brought me.

497
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,953
Noah, this is not the way.

498
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:44,165
All flesh is grass, man.

499
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:45,767
Oh, enough of your
fucking bullshit.

500
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,467
Without me, you
wouldn't have even got in here.

501
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,469
You'd still be on
the outside throwing rocks.

502
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:53,841
So wind your fucking neck in and
remember what we're here to do.

503
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,458
<i>We've got multiple reports</i>

504
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,261
<i>of an SOS at Agnian Tower.</i>

505
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,395
<i>Someone's lit a signal</i>
<i>halfway up the building.</i>

506
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,803
What the fuck is this?

507
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:24,205
Just
a little extra persuasion.

508
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,773
<i>I hate to interrupt</i>
<i>circle time,</i>

509
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:28,308
<i>but we have an iceberg on</i>
<i>the horizon.</i>

510
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,946
- Police inbound rapid response.
- How?

511
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,849
There's a fucking SOS
on the side of the building.

512
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,518
<i>- Someone went old school.</i>
- Outside?

513
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,954
What, one of the cleaners?

514
00:38:40,353 --> 00:38:41,656
Find them.

515
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,926
Zee, send
a message to the police

516
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,094
<i>warning we have hostages.</i>

517
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:00,875
No.

518
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,411
<i>Noah, we have a runner.</i>

519
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,793
<i>The cleaner's</i>
<i>not going anywhere. Get Gerald.</i>

520
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,728
Zee, there's
an override to the cradle.

521
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,629
Sweet.

522
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:24,632
Bring her up. Bring her in.

523
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:25,693
That was very,
very stupid, Gerald.

524
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:29,096
Window cleaner banjaxed
the cradle. She's stuck.

525
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,165
<i>- One down from you.</i>
<i>- Fuck her.</i>

526
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,667
Let her sweat.

527
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,941
You've already killed one
Milton. We can't lose 'em both.

528
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:42,543
Nobody's listening to you,
Marcus.

529
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:49,449
What is this, a fucking coup?

530
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:51,052
- Put the gun down.
- You know,

531
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:52,119
I don't think I will.

532
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,088
You wanna pull this
shit when we're this close?

533
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,290
But we're not close,
are we? We're not fucking close.

534
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:58,659
You stupid, arrogant bastard.

535
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:02,763
Nothing has changed,
bro. The world is still dying.

536
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,365
Fuck this hearts and
minds bullshit.

537
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:05,700
It's time for some
shock and awe.

538
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:09,570
Noah, put the fucking
gun down or I'll put you down.

539
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:28,022
No, you won't.
That's why I have to do this.

540
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,826
See, you, you're lucky,
Gerry. You, I need.

541
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,264
But I'm in now, Marcus,

542
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:40,101
and I'm gonna be throwing
a lot more than fucking rocks.

543
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:50,244
I'm only gonna ask you this
once, Wyatt. Are you in or out?

544
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:56,784
Zee?

545
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:00,321
Looks like I'm all in.

546
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,156
Look, I'm sorry,
man. Really, I am.

547
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,658
But you still think
that people are the solution.

548
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:06,660
People are the problem.

549
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,131
I mean, look at me.

550
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,836
It's too late for a revolution,
Marcus. This is a reckoning.

551
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,539
Zee, stream this to our guests.

552
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:24,779
<i>So, Gerry's had his fun, and</i>
<i>after a brief chat with Marcus,</i>

553
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,915
<i>the headline is we're</i>
<i>now under new management.</i>

554
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:31,852
<i>I know some of you were loyal</i>
<i>to Marcus, but that's done.</i>

555
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:36,457
<i>It's my way now. Same broad</i>
<i>strokes, just a few key changes.</i>

556
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,726
<i>True believers only.</i>

557
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:54,141
Every movement
needs its martyrs.

558
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:02,283
Who's on the outside now?

559
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,938
Try running now.

560
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,211
As soon as we're done, you
get the explosives ready, okay?

561
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,180
What about your cleaner?
We should get rid of her.

562
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:34,715
And we've a chopper inbound.

563
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,117
<i>Helicopter in the air.</i>

564
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,818
That's full pig bingo.

565
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,290
Please tell me this shitshow
comes with a fucking plan.

566
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:46,393
Relax, Zee. They're
still coming clean tonight.

567
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,496
You're still gonna dig
through all their dirty laundry.

568
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,233
Marcus was right about one
thing. The truth does matter.

569
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,468
Without it, they'll just
smear us as cranks and crazies,

570
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:55,870
a bunch of murdering psychos,

571
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,439
but the truth by itself
changes nothing.

572
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:03,744
Strap 'em up.

573
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,656
You've got this,
Joey, like riding a bike,

574
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,391
700 feet high in
a mangled fucking cradle

575
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:51,725
having dead bodies
thrown at you.

576
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:17,284
I really wish you
weren't here right now.

577
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:18,687
Derek had to be Derek.

578
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,987
Course he did.

579
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,260
Now, are you gonna try
and talk me out of it too, Joey?

580
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,095
Like he did? No.

581
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:29,296
Okay.

582
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,998
You're killing people, Noah.

583
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,234
I am killing people,

584
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,436
the ones that get in my way.
But it's not personal.

585
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:36,705
Actually, you know what?
Fuck that.

586
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,739
It is kind of deeply personal.

587
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:42,476
But everyone's got a personal,
Joey. What's yours?

588
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,145
And Michael?

589
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,583
Please tell me
he's not still here.

590
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:50,818
He left. Got bored waiting.

591
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,456
Hey, guys, our cleaner's
little brother, Michael Locke,

592
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:56,824
is somewhere in the building.

593
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,560
Zee'll send you
a picture of him now.

594
00:45:58,593 --> 00:46:00,828
Could you find him
and bring him to me?

595
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,531
Poor fucking bastard.

596
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:06,367
You leave him stuck in
some shithole home for years.

597
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,168
You talk about him
like he's an embarrassment.

598
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:09,803
Like somehow you've
had it tougher than him.

599
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,872
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is fucking true.

600
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:13,274
Don't lie to yourself
right now, Joey.

601
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,876
And then the one time
that you are here for him,

602
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,579
you bring him into this.

603
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:20,347
Sister of the fucking year,
you are.

604
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:21,683
If you touch him...

605
00:46:21,716 --> 00:46:24,084
- I thought he'd left.
- I will end you.

606
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:26,787
Oooh. That's a bit dark,
isn't it?

607
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,858
I told you. Personal.

608
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:35,496
<i>My name is Denise Slater.</i>

609
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:38,899
<i>I am the minister for energy.</i>

610
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:42,303
<i>I speak to you</i>
<i>today to confess to actions</i>

611
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:45,573
<i>- that I can no longer conceal.</i>
- Fuck. Come on.

612
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:48,643
<i>For years, I have</i>
<i>accepted bribes from Agnian.</i>

613
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:51,412
<i>I received in</i>
<i>excess of £2 million</i>

614
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:54,516
<i>to obstruct</i>
<i>an inquiry into Agnian's site...</i>

615
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:55,717
<i>Sierra Oscar.</i>

616
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,585
<i>Units on route</i>
<i>to the Agnian Tower.</i>

617
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,053
We're way off on the hack.

618
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,455
They've only just
started spilling their guts.

619
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,124
And we've got maybe two
minutes till the feds show.

620
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:07,361
<i>Noah, we're not ready.</i>
<i>We need more time.</i>

621
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:14,234
Your guests are almost here.

622
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:18,005
You invited them,
Joey. This is your night.

623
00:47:26,548 --> 00:47:28,115
<i>999.</i>

624
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:31,118
There's a crazy woman outside
the Agnian Tower with a gun.

625
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:35,557
She's gonna kill someone. You
need to get here. Get here now.

626
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,591
You fucking psycho.

627
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,493
- I thought we were friends.
- I thought we were friends.

628
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,395
Well, friends help each other,
don't they?

629
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:43,931
So why don't you
point that gun at the street,

630
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:46,233
straight down,
and empty the clip?

631
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,868
Go fuck yourself.

632
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:52,873
Oh, shit.

633
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:55,744
Look who it is.
Halina.

634
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:58,580
- She's nothing to do with them.
- She takes their money. Shoot.

635
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:00,180
- Noah, she's pregnant.
- Even more of a reason.

636
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,449
This is no world to be bringing
a kid into, now, is it?

637
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:03,852
Don't do it, please.

638
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,185
If you don't want her to die,

639
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,855
all you have to do is
get shooting.

640
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,456
Lose the silencer.
Let's make a bang.

641
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,693
And no easy shots.

642
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:13,494
Make 'em dance.

643
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:44,925
See? I told you.
Like fucking ants.

644
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,656
Okay, got the target.

645
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,095
Let's go! Everybody! Now!

646
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:25,600
Out! Come on!
Come on! Quickly, move!

647
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:29,369
- Out, out! Go, go, go! Come on!
- This way.

648
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:30,705
Out now!

649
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,448
You're sick!

650
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,518
I'll let you know
when we find Mikey.

651
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:46,119
<i>Turn around.</i>

652
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,355
<i>Put your hands in the air.</i>

653
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:01,268
<i>We're hearing reports that</i>
<i>the Agnian Tower is under siege.</i>

654
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:03,805
<i>While we are awaiting</i>
<i>confirmation of hostages,</i>

655
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,173
<i>we can confirm that</i>
<i>several shots</i>

656
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:08,910
<i>were fired from halfway up</i>
<i>the building itself</i>

657
00:50:08,943 --> 00:50:11,546
<i>by an as yet unidentified woman.</i>

658
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,515
I think it's fair to
say the cleaner

659
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:14,649
has their full attention.

660
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,250
<i>Well,</i>
<i>let's make sure she keeps it.</i>

661
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:18,285
Transfer some
of the Milton brothers' funds

662
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:19,587
into Joanna Locke's account.

663
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:22,322
<i>Say, 33 million.</i>

664
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:24,692
I'm sorry. How many million?

665
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,563
- Guv.
- Yes.

666
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:30,464
Ground commander for the night.
Lucky you, right?

667
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:32,700
Yeah, lucky me.
Right, what we got?

668
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:36,136
Nothing on the hostages yet.
Shareholder event for Agnian.

669
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:38,438
We have workers,
staff and high-profile guests,

670
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:41,743
including Denise Slater,
the minister for energy.

671
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:44,579
We have 102 phone signals,
all non-responsive.

672
00:50:44,612 --> 00:50:46,446
No demands as yet,
but the SOS was followed

673
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,215
by a coded
warning about the hostages,

674
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:49,116
then the call
about the shooter.

675
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,552
Casualties?

676
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:53,153
One body on the cradle with
the shooter. None on the ground.

677
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:55,924
Spotters have ID'd
the shooter as Joanna Locke,

678
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:57,525
one of the window cleaners.

679
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:58,893
Ex-army. SRR.

680
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:00,294
Made it through
Marine selection,

681
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,630
only to assault a squad mate,
then quit.

682
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:05,399
Troubled childhood,
abusive father, brother in care.

683
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:07,569
Drug fines, self-medicating.

684
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:10,672
- Classic unstable ex-soldier.
- Yeah, maybe.

685
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,041
Get urgent authorities in place

686
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,108
for her socials,
her phones, her finances.

687
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:16,778
You know, a deep,
detailed picture,

688
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:19,013
not a way too easy, lazy answer.

689
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,949
Yes, guv. Sorry, guv.

690
00:51:20,982 --> 00:51:22,617
No, you could be right.
Let's see.

691
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,652
We're gonna have to ruin
the commissioner's bridge night.

692
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:27,220
He'll need to brief the home
secretary and the mayor.

693
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,590
Who have we got from SCO19?

694
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,158
- Stormin' Norman.
- Yeah, course. Who else?

695
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:34,161
Right, well, if I get too
punchy, just give me the signal.

696
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:37,331
Yes, guv.
What do I do when you ignore it?

697
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,300
Speak of the devil.

698
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:42,070
- Snipers are in place, ma'am.
- Thank you.

699
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,571
Yes, we need to make
contact with the shooter,

700
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,272
work out what
the hell is going on.

701
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:49,811
- Waiting for your mark.
- Yes, I heard. Thank you.

702
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:55,683
I've got the shot.

703
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:59,286
I'm not with them!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

704
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:00,487
I'm not one for doing nothing.

705
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:01,623
We're not doing nothing, Royce.

706
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:03,423
We're waiting
till we learn more.

707
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,192
If she lit that sign
because she wanted attention,

708
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:06,894
she's not putting on
much of a show,

709
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:08,963
no matter how much someone
wants us to think that.

710
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:10,832
Nobody makes
a move unless I say so.

711
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:12,232
- Ma'am.
- Hmm?

712
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:14,902
Thirty-three million just landed
in Joanna Locke's account.

713
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:16,436
From the Milton brothers.

714
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,773
She's just fired seven rounds
into St. Thomas's Street.

715
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:19,807
Into the street.

716
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:22,442
Now, either that's blind luck
or she's ex-SRR,

717
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:26,014
she knows exactly how
to hit a target and miss one.

718
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:27,414
Unless she's unstable.

719
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:36,591
<i>She's going</i>
<i>for the body.</i>

720
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:37,892
Hold your fire.

721
00:52:56,044 --> 00:52:58,211
<i>She's holding a device.</i>

722
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,002
<i>999. What's</i>
<i>your emergency?</i>

723
00:53:21,035 --> 00:53:23,538
Are you fucking kidding me?

724
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,315
Guv. For you. It's Joey Locke.

725
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,351
Tell the chopper to back off.

726
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:41,556
Hello, Joey?

727
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:44,058
<i>Don't shoot!</i>
<i>I'm not with them.</i>

728
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,160
We won't shoot.

729
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:48,361
<i>This is</i>
<i>Superintendent Claire Hume.</i>

730
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,198
<i>And I repeat,</i>
<i>we will not shoot.</i>

731
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,398
Great.

732
00:53:51,431 --> 00:53:53,266
We're gonna get you
down as soon as we can.

733
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,435
Forget about me.
You need to get inside.

734
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:58,005
<i>- And we will.</i>
- My brother's in the building.

735
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:00,474
<i>- His name is Michael Locke.</i>
- We're gonna get him too.

736
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:03,144
<i>You have to find him,</i>
<i>please. Please.</i>

737
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:05,412
You mentioned a 'them'?

738
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:09,282
<i>My news outlets,</i>
<i>under my personal direction,</i>

739
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:15,322
<i>have consistently,</i>
<i>repeatedly, perpetuated the myth</i>

740
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:18,291
<i>- that climate change is a hoax.</i>
- Naughty boy.

741
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:20,061
It's time to admit my complicity

742
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,196
in the downplaying
of climate change.

743
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,264
I didn't do anything.
I shouldn't be here.

744
00:54:24,297 --> 00:54:27,735
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
undersell yourself, Jennifer.

745
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,904
You know where all
the bodies are buried.

746
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,874
Now, you can either
tell us where to dig,

747
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:34,909
or you can join Geoff here.

748
00:54:39,147 --> 00:54:41,983
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is he freaking you out?

749
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:44,685
Do you want me to move him?

750
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:48,623
No.

751
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,068
Someone needs to get inside.

752
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,937
Oh, believe me, we're on it.
We just need to assess.

753
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,238
<i>Hume, listen to me...</i>

754
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:07,175
Joey, I'm gonna have to call you
back, but we will get you down.

755
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,811
I don't wanna get down.
I wanna get in.

756
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:11,279
Fuck!

757
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,948
Noah Santos.
No socials and no record.

758
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,482
Clean as a whistle.

759
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:19,720
I cross-checked his work ID.
They match with this guy.

760
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:21,989
He was calling
himself Lucas Vander then,

761
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:25,793
a member of the Seventh Harvest,
an anti-humanist group.

762
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:28,629
- Anti-humanist? As in...?
- As in...

763
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:30,865
<i>Man is a blight upon the world.</i>

764
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,533
<i>A cancer, a virus.</i>

765
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,501
<i>And for the human</i>
<i>virus to be controlled</i>

766
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:37,872
<i>requires a radical,</i>
<i>invasive approach.</i>

767
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:39,406
Delightful.

768
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,441
Close to no followers.
On the fringes of the fringe.

769
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,811
Not even worth
putting on the watch list.

770
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:45,378
But last year
he shows up in the orbit

771
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,882
of someone who
was on the watch list.

772
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:49,482
Marcus Blake.

773
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:51,252
The man we just
peeled off the pavement.

774
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:54,555
Leader of Earth Revolution,
a radical environmental group.

775
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:57,424
Extreme but organised.
Well connected, well resourced.

776
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,527
Linked to the sabotage
of the Dakar refinery

777
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,996
and the Laguna Taracoa
facility last year.

778
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,496
Laguna Taracoa? That's Agnian.

779
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:06,167
There were warnings given
at those attacks. No casualties.

780
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,136
One was arrested at Taracoa,
practically handed herself in.

781
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,507
It's the Earth Revolution MO.
Get attention, make their case.

782
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,576
Only this time, Elena Lanza
gets herself knifed

783
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,879
in jail for the cause.

784
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:21,148
So, Marcus Blake,
an extremist, not a killer.

785
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:23,217
Now he's dead,

786
00:56:23,251 --> 00:56:25,586
murdered by Noah Santos.

787
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,454
Dial me in.

788
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,991
Do it.

789
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:34,461
<i>The first casualty</i>
<i>at the Agnian siege in London</i>

790
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,964
<i>has been</i>
<i>identified as environmentalist</i>

791
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:40,368
<i>and radical</i>
<i>eco-activist Marcus Blake.</i>

792
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,036
<i>With Blake dead, it is</i>
<i>not yet clear</i>

793
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:46,140
<i>who is in control of what is a</i>
<i>rapidly escalating situation.</i>

794
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:56,884
Through no choice of my own,

795
00:56:56,918 --> 00:57:00,321
I, James Horsley,
am compelled to reveal the truth

796
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:07,695
about my part in regards to
Agnian and the Milton brothers.

797
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:10,298
I personally oversaw the payment
of millions in settlements

798
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,800
to silence whistleblowers
and complainants.

799
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:15,102
All people are like grass
and all their faithfulness

800
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:16,436
like the flowers in the field.

801
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,339
Grass withers
and the flowers fall,

802
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:21,208
but the breath
of the Lord remains forever.

803
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,978
- You good?
- I'm terrified.

804
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,218
What happens if
it loses my pulse?

805
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:34,689
You'll have about five seconds
for it to find it again.

806
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,233
Good to know.

807
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:49,003
<i>Superintendent Claire Hume</i>
<i>is on the line.</i>

808
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:50,604
Hmm, patch her through.

809
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:53,207
Are you still with
us for phase two, Zee?

810
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:56,544
Yes.

811
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,014
Great to have you onboard.

812
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:03,483
- Noah Santos?
<i>- Detective Claire Hume.</i>

813
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:06,153
Superintendent. But,
then, I think you knew that.

814
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:08,488
Would you prefer Noah or Lucas?

815
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:10,958
Let's stick with Noah.
I outgrew Lucas.

816
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:12,360
Are you in charge
down there, Claire?

817
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,462
Yes. You in charge up there?

818
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:15,930
<i>I am now, yeah.</i>

819
00:58:15,963 --> 00:58:17,631
What happened
with Marcus Blake?

820
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:19,000
Creative differences.

821
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:21,268
Your boys in the chopper
and on the rooftops should know

822
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,771
<i>that I'm wearing a dead man's</i>
<i>switch synched to my pulse,</i>

823
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:26,874
<i>so if my heart stops beating,</i>
<i>the whole building explodes.</i>

824
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:28,609
Likewise,
any attempt to gain access,

825
00:58:28,642 --> 00:58:31,479
<i>cutting the power,</i>
<i>and I start detonating hostages.</i>

826
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:34,548
If you think I might blink,
ask Marcus Blake.

827
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,657
As the CEO of Beacon Social...

828
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,493
Gerald
and the board are confessing

829
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:47,328
to their systemic
violation of the planet.

830
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,763
They're far from
the only guilty ones.

831
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,765
<i>You're putting</i>
<i>them on trial.</i>

832
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,967
Tonight's about consequences,
Claire. You reap what you sow.

833
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,368
Okay, well, while
they're confessing,

834
00:58:54,402 --> 00:58:55,770
why don't we let the others go?

835
00:58:55,803 --> 00:58:57,204
<i>I understand you have</i>
<i>issues with the Miltons,</i>

836
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:58,372
<i>but you have people in there</i>

837
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:00,875
who are guilty of nothing more
than showing up for work.

838
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,576
<i>They're enabling</i>
<i>parasites.</i>

839
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,311
<i>Nobody gets a free pass.</i>

840
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:06,013
Why aren't
the others moving, Noah?

841
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:10,351
Ahh. Inhalational anaesthetic.
They'll be out long enough.

842
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:14,422
Long enough for...? What are
you trying to achieve tonight?

843
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:15,956
<i>You know, justice,</i>

844
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:19,126
saving the world,
that kind of thing.

845
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,294
Big ask.

846
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:24,198
You don't strike me as the naive
type, Noah. Blake, maybe.

847
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,367
See, you have to see
the long game here, Claire.

848
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,568
You didn't listen to the Gretas.

849
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:28,936
You wouldn't listen
to the Marcus's.

850
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,172
You lose your shit if someone
throws oil at a painting,

851
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:33,140
blocks the motorway,
crashes the big match.

852
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:35,776
Well, too late, because
now you get someone like me.

853
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,678
I'm struggling to join the dots
between strapping

854
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:40,549
explosives to innocent people
and saving the world.

855
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,416
See, your first mistake
is thinking that anyone

856
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,552
in here is innocent.

857
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,554
<i>Do you hate people, Noah?</i>

858
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,354
I hate what we've
done to the world, yeah.

859
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:49,757
I mean, you're talking
about saving, what, 100 people?

860
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,426
<i>These bastards have been raping</i>
<i>the planet and getting fat on it</i>

861
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,961
<i>and you still</i>
<i>think I'm the bad guy.</i>

862
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:55,896
So this is
a numbers game for you.

863
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,264
There we go.

864
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:03,471
Speaking of numbers, Claire,

865
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:06,841
why are there five SWAT guys
sniffing around the entrance?

866
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,310
Get them back now.

867
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,113
- Pull back. Pull back!
- We're moving back, Noah.

868
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:14,715
Great, cos you have
five seconds, one per guy.

869
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,283
We're moving back.

870
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:20,154
And three, two...

871
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:22,189
I told you, we're back.

872
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:26,794
Well done, Claire. Thank you.

873
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:44,745
<i>- Still there?</i>
- They have families, Noah.

874
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:47,414
Well, now they don't. Like
you said, it's a numbers game.

875
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:50,351
<i>What kind of numbers</i>
<i>depend on you, so till I'm done,</i>

876
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:52,887
stay the fuck back.

877
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,757
Don't you
ever go behind my back again!

878
01:00:58,993 --> 01:01:00,529
<i>Five police officers</i>

879
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:03,230
<i>have been killed in a blast</i>
<i>at the Agnian Tower siege</i>

880
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:06,700
<i>in what is becoming a truly</i>
<i>horrific night for London.</i>

881
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:09,571
<i>The men were all</i>
<i>serving SCO19 officers.</i>

882
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:11,606
<i>Anti-humanist terrorist,</i>
<i>Noah Santos,</i>

883
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,140
<i>has yet to make any demands,</i>

884
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:16,710
<i>and so far no</i>
<i>hostages have been released.</i>

885
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,451
- Joey.
<i>- I warned you.</i>

886
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:25,719
<i>What the hell are you thinking?</i>

887
01:01:25,753 --> 01:01:27,922
Noah's hooked up
to a dead man's switch,

888
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:30,625
<i>so we can't move our teams in,</i>
<i>we can't get the hostages out.</i>

889
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,259
<i>He's got us by the balls.</i>

890
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:33,961
You, maybe. I'm going in.

891
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,263
- How are you gonna do that?
<i>- I'm working on it.</i>

892
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,799
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>else you can tell me?</i>

893
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,501
We know that
Noah's after confessions

894
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,970
<i>and Agnian files before</i>
<i>he goes live with it all,</i>

895
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,739
<i>and we think he's running</i>
<i>it through the control room.</i>

896
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,875
I'll do my best.

897
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:49,143
You wanna hang this
whole operation

898
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:50,612
on a window cleaner
who couldn't hack the army?

899
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:53,280
At least she didn't just send
five men to their deaths, Royce.

900
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,050
We need an opening
and she can give us one.

901
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:03,958
Helping the pigs, that's
a new low, even for you, Joey.

902
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:06,561
Oh, I don't know. Beats murder.

903
01:02:06,595 --> 01:02:07,962
I'm sorry that you stayed late,

904
01:02:07,995 --> 01:02:09,430
I'm sorry that you got
in my way,

905
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:11,666
and I'm sorry that you can't
see what I'm trying to do here,

906
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,933
but that's irrelevant,

907
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,969
because by the end of tonight,
everyone will see,

908
01:02:15,002 --> 01:02:17,271
<i>and you're not stopping them.</i>

909
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:19,039
<i>Repeat,</i>
<i>I have visuals on an IED.</i>

910
01:02:19,073 --> 01:02:20,575
Joey, you need to move now.

911
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:22,776
Explosives coming your way.

912
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,422
Come on, Joey. Come on.

913
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:18,767
<i>I knew that</i>
<i>the Agnian brand was associated</i>

914
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,903
<i>with pollution and exploitation.</i>

915
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:26,040
<i>I knew the Miltons'</i>
<i>reputation...</i>

916
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:30,344
<i>and I knowingly helped</i>
<i>to rebrand and greenwash</i>

917
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,580
<i>Agnian's criminal...</i>

918
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:35,949
<i>She's dead.</i>
<i>We have visual confirmation.</i>

919
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,951
Joanna Locke is dead.

920
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:42,524
Messy. Bye-bye, bitch.

921
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,358
If you believe that.

922
01:03:55,869 --> 01:03:58,205
Come on, Joey.
Tell me you're still there.

923
01:03:58,238 --> 01:03:59,774
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.</i>

924
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,475
Thank God for that.
Are you okay?

925
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:02,976
I'm okay.

926
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,680
<i>Stay dead.</i>
<i>It'll buy us some time.</i>

927
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:06,914
Right.

928
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,552
Hopefully they won't see me
climbing in through that hole.

929
01:04:11,218 --> 01:04:12,386
What hole?

930
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,155
The one your snipers are
gonna put through the glass.

931
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:18,425
On it.

932
01:04:24,465 --> 01:04:27,434
As the personal assistant
to the Milton brothers,

933
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:31,405
I've been a silent
witness to a web of corruption.

934
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:34,108
Splitting the team's a risk.

935
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,143
So is assuming she's dead.

936
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:38,646
<i>I need an update, Zee.</i>

937
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,048
By the time you get Gerald's
confession, I'll be done.

938
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:42,149
Go.

939
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:45,886
I've allowed
myself to be manipulated...

940
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:49,390
You're up, Gerry.

941
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,694
What do you care what we say?

942
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:55,262
Do you really think anybody will
listen after what you've done?

943
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,300
Without the truth, no.
With the truth, enough will.

944
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,637
We're making
history tonight, Gerry.

945
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,238
And you'll let us go?

946
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:07,007
You have my word that we're
all going out the same way.

947
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,475
<i>We've just received</i>
<i>this statement</i>

948
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,178
<i>from the Mayor of London</i>
<i>denouncing Noah Santos.</i>

949
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,947
<i>She says: 'I condemn this</i>
<i>senseless violence</i>

950
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:16,216
<i>and murder in the</i>
<i>strongest terms.'</i>

951
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,152
<i>'There can be no</i>
<i>justification whatsoever</i>

952
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:20,421
<i>for these</i>
<i>barbaric acts.'</i>

953
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:23,725
<i>'This is not activism.</i>
<i>It is terrorism.'</i>

954
01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:46,781
So, I know you
need to concentrate...

955
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:48,415
<i>Don't stop.</i>

956
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:50,852
Takes my mind off the
massive fall

957
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:53,320
and the dickheads with guns.

958
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:57,157
Climbing's the easy bit.
Been doing it since I was six.

959
01:05:57,892 --> 01:05:59,928
How's the team with me going in?

960
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,196
Bet they loved me
bailing on the army.

961
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:04,566
Well, not to stress
you out or anything...

962
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:07,367
- You wanna know why I quit?
<i>- You served four years.</i>

963
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:10,505
<i>You made it all the way through</i>
<i>selection only to walk away.</i>

964
01:06:14,374 --> 01:06:16,210
I grew up watching an
angry man act out

965
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:18,613
on everyone else
and I did nothing about it.

966
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:20,682
Get to the commando course,

967
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,982
one of the pricks I beat

968
01:06:22,015 --> 01:06:23,785
couldn't handle being
beaten by a woman.

969
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:24,819
Huh.

970
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:26,153
<i>He baited me, I bit.</i>

971
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,355
Quit before they could bin me.

972
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:30,090
Could have fought your corner.

973
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:33,761
No, you don't do that.
Except this time.

974
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:39,399
This time it's
not just my corner.

975
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:42,670
Michael.

976
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:46,340
Whenever our dad
started on Michael,

977
01:06:46,373 --> 01:06:49,109
I'd open the window, climb out,

978
01:06:49,911 --> 01:06:52,179
sit on the ledge
till it was over.

979
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:55,884
This time I'm not leaving him.

980
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:57,619
I can be stubborn when I want.

981
01:06:57,652 --> 01:07:00,688
Me too. Stubborn's
just what we need right now.

982
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:03,156
<i>How does being stubborn</i>
<i>and hostage negotiation work?</i>

983
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,792
Well, better
at work than at home.

984
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:06,393
You're a train wreck too?

985
01:07:06,426 --> 01:07:10,798
Well, what do you want first?
Marriage one, two, three?

986
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,235
Right, listen, they're gonna be
onto you soon,

987
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:16,638
so let me call Noah.

988
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:19,106
If he's talking to me, then
he's not thinking about you.

989
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:20,407
<i>That's cool.</i>

990
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,910
Train wreck crew.

991
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:23,645
Train wreck crew.

992
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:29,082
<i>I wish to confess</i>
<i>to the profound misdeeds...</i>

993
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,919
<i>...that I</i>
<i>and my brother Geoffrey</i>

994
01:07:30,952 --> 01:07:35,255
presided over as CEOs of Agnian.

995
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:37,257
- Miss me, Claire?
<i>- Well, I've been thinking.</i>

996
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,827
<i>You know what you</i>
<i>remind me of, Noah?</i>

997
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:43,898
One of those wasps. I don't know
their name. You probably do.

998
01:07:43,932 --> 01:07:45,833
They lay their eggs
in moth larvae

999
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,235
and then they take
over from within.

1000
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:51,806
- Ichneumon wasps?
<i>- Ichneumon wasps.</i>

1001
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,675
Marcus Blake, he was the moth.

1002
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:55,710
You killed
everything Earth Revolution was.

1003
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:58,980
<i>You perverted everything</i>
<i>that Blake was fighting for.</i>

1004
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:01,049
You called me
just to tell me that?

1005
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,951
Those hostages,
they must be close to waking up.

1006
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:05,620
I think it's time we agreed
the best way they can walk out.

1007
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:07,855
In 40 minutes,
we'll walk out with them

1008
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:09,089
onto the coaches that
you are going

1009
01:08:09,122 --> 01:08:10,190
to allow through
the perimeter.

1010
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:11,425
At which point,

1011
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,360
we will drive 300 metres,
up St. Thomas Street,

1012
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:16,698
<i>where, provided you behave,</i>
<i>we'll release half the hostages.</i>

1013
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:17,899
Then?

1014
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:19,333
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, now.

1015
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,869
I need assurances
you'll release all of them.

1016
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:25,006
We will, once we're well clear
of here and the truth is out.

1017
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:26,774
<i>Any attempts</i>
<i>to get clever will result</i>

1018
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:29,744
<i>in more bad headlines</i>
<i>and dead bodies.</i>

1019
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:34,348
In the following cases,
such as that of Elena Lanza,

1020
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:39,353
contract killings were tacitly
but knowingly encouraged.

1021
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:41,856
We are guilty.

1022
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:45,392
And that's a fucking wrap.

1023
01:08:54,802 --> 01:08:57,371
Joey, we're running out of time.

1024
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:25,265
Oh, my God.

1025
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:28,268
- Are you okay?
- No, not okay.

1026
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:29,737
I'm quite stressed.

1027
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:33,007
Squeeze.

1028
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:36,176
- Can I get up first?
- Yes. Good idea.

1029
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:39,246
There's some
crazy stuff going on.

1030
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:49,757
Hume, I'm in. I'm inside.

1031
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:52,894
Well done. Now get moving.
They'll be coming for you.

1032
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:08,810
- She's alive. She's inside.
- Then fucking find her.

1033
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:18,186
- Come on, come on. Come on.
- What about the hostages?

1034
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,321
- We're not gonna let them die.
- What about us?

1035
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:26,226
- We're not gonna die either.
- What if we do?

1036
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:29,097
Michael.

1037
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,398
Michael, we have to go.

1038
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:34,202
- I'm scared, Joanna.
- I'm scared too.

1039
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:37,505
But we can't stop,
not here, not now.

1040
01:10:38,005 --> 01:10:39,941
Michael. Michael.

1041
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,276
- I need you.
- You need me?

1042
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:46,547
Noah's after some files.
I need you to hack them.

1043
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:50,752
Remember when the Avengers
steal the Infinity Stones?

1044
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:52,954
Yes, they had
to build a time machine.

1045
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:54,354
Forget the time machine.

1046
01:10:54,387 --> 01:10:55,523
They steal the stones.

1047
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:58,325
Thanos goes crazy trying
to get them back.

1048
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:01,461
We're gonna steal
Noah's Infinity Stones.

1049
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,234
- Just checking. You mean...
- The files.

1050
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,035
I mean the files.

1051
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:10,938
Okay, come on.

1052
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:12,907
I told you what would happen
if you tried to interfere,

1053
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,908
didn't I, Claire?

1054
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:15,342
My teams haven't moved, Noah,

1055
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,644
so if there's trouble on
the inside,

1056
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:18,311
then it's outside
both our control.

1057
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,748
You know ichneumon wasps,
they have another name.

1058
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:22,517
They're a, they're
called Darwin wasps.

1059
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,019
See, Darwin thought
that a creature surviving

1060
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:26,254
through the
destruction of another

1061
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:29,056
was proof against
the existence of God,

1062
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,726
as if man wasn't proof enough.

1063
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,301
But soon I'll have
the truth and so will you.

1064
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:42,770
<i>Bye Claire.</i>

1065
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:47,708
Did he just blink?

1066
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:55,583
<i>Man has no</i>
<i>preordained right to exist.</i>

1067
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,618
<i>In fact, I'd argue that</i>
<i>we had our chance to exist</i>

1068
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:00,188
<i>in balance with nature</i>
<i>and everything around us</i>

1069
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:02,422
<i>and we set it all on fire.</i>

1070
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:06,828
No, I don't think he did.
He's gonna kill them all.

1071
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,680
Quick.

1072
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,658
If we get out of this,

1073
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:40,328
can we do something together,
like a, like a joust?

1074
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,697
Well, no, not a joust.
I can't ride a horse.

1075
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,068
We could go snorkelling.

1076
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,505
I don't like it here.

1077
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:54,374
Yeah. Neither will they.

1078
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,691
Stay here.

1079
01:14:02,843 --> 01:14:04,477
Put it down.

1080
01:14:59,467 --> 01:15:00,868
Joey!

1081
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:21,222
So well, what now, great leader?

1082
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,757
We show the world why we came.

1083
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,859
<i>Only one more confession</i>
<i>coming after Gerald's.</i>

1084
01:15:24,892 --> 01:15:26,927
I need four minutes to encrypt,
then it's showtime.

1085
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:30,264
Socials, news. There
won't be a feed it doesn't hit.

1086
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:32,299
I hope it's worth it,

1087
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,768
because so far the entire world

1088
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:36,237
thinks you're a terrorist
whack job.

1089
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,772

<i>I give you this truth</i>

1098

1105

1130
01:17:54,808 --> 01:17:56,578
The update is
your plan's fucked.

1131
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:59,914
I've got the evidence and your
weird angry-man YouTube rant.

1132
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:01,849
It doesn't matter how
many people you kill, Noah,

1133
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:03,317
no one will ever know why.

1134
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,453
You're just another

1136
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,430
Hume, he's going
to blow the building.

1137
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:17,464
He's going to kill everyone.

1138
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,534
We know. We're coming in

1139
01:18:19,568 --> 01:18:21,335
<i>- and you need to get out now.</i>
- No.

1140
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:23,437
I've got what he wants.
He'll come after me.

1141
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,539
I'll deal with that switch.

1142
01:18:24,573 --> 01:18:26,073
You get as many people
out as you can.

1147
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:38,352
I need you to take care of him.
It's a numbers game, right?

1148
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:41,055
Copy that, Joey. I will.

1149
01:18:42,122 --> 01:18:43,123
Good luck.

1150
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:44,992
They're going to look after you.

1151
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:46,293
You're going to be okay,
I promise.

1152
01:18:46,327 --> 01:18:48,462
- But you have to go.
- No, wait. What about you?

1153
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:50,998
As long as Noah's chasing me,
they can save more people...

1154

- No.
- and you can get out.

1155
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,570
- No, but you need me.
- I'll be right behind you.

1156
01:18:55,604 --> 01:18:58,372
- I need you.
- You don't.

1157
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:01,175
You were right, I was
never there for you. I wasn't.

1158
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:02,910
- No, please.
- I wasn't, and I'm sorry.

1159
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:04,979
- No.
- You were right.

1160

- No.
- It was always later.

Please.

1164
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:43,784
Bastard! You
said you'd let us go!

Hey, Joey.

01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:51,071
I really wish you

1181

A world with nobody.

Nice, Joey.

1188
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,273
Finally putting other people's
interests above your own.

1189
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:28,910
Shame, though, it's the wrong

Joey.

1201
01:25:35,168 --> 01:25:36,638
Train wreck crew.

Right, there'll be more

Debriefs can come later.
And the evidence that you took.

1207
01:25:55,389 --> 01:25:58,026
The higher-ups are
insisting you hand it over,

1208
01:25:58,059 --> 01:26:00,061
just so that this
can all get processed

1209

through the correct channels.

1210
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:04,498
It would be
a shame if after all that,

1211
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:07,835
all those dirty little secrets
stayed buried, wouldn't it?

1212
01:26:08,803 --> 01:26:09,904
Yeah, it would.

1213
01:26:09,937 --> 01:26:10,905
Hmm.

01:26:10,938 --> 01:26:13,508
We don't have it. We never did.

1215
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,143
I was bluffing

1216
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:18,378
That's what I thought. Smart.

1217
01:26:22,215 --> 01:26:24,686
You did a good

1218

Don't stop now.

1219
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:30,390

1221
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:09,362
Got the drive?

1222
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:13,266

01:28:10,024 --> 01:28:11,692
- It's just...
- What?

1242
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,261
Something's
been bugging me since the tower.

1243
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:14,461
Okay.

1244
01:28:14,494 --> 01:28:16,631
Okay, Thanos didn't
just hunt down

1245
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:18,800
the Avengers' Infinity Stones.

1246
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,035
I don't think that's
doing the Russo brothers,

1247
01:28:21,068 --> 01:28:23,004
Kevin Feige or <i>Endgame</i> justice.

1248
01:28:23,037 --> 01:28:24,504
That's been bugging you?

1249
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:26,874
Look, I just
feel like you simplified it.

1250
01:28:26,908 --> 01:28:28,876
Mmm...
We were in an armed siege.

1251
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,779
Okay...
